	<h2> American Hertiage Girls </h2>
	<p> American Heritage Girls is a scouting organization for ages 5 to 18. It teaches them
	leadership and job skills.</p>
	<p> I was in AHG from ages 13 to 16 or grades 7 to 10. During my time in the program 
	I recived many badges that trained me in many diffrent skills and abilites from bike saftey to cake decorating. I learned many things
	at many diffrent events, I learned how to preform first aid and CPR. I took a first responders course, a lifeguard course and test, 
	and self defense and so much more. I had the chance to not just perticipate in service projects I have 
	sponsered a blood drive for the past 4 years and will continue to do so.</p>
